# VE281: Data Structures and Algorithms – Course Projects

This repository contains 4 projects completed for **VE281 (Data Structures and Algorithms)** at UM-SJTU Joint Institute.

## Projects

- **Project 1 – Sorting**
  - Implemented 5 basic sorting algorithms (bubble, insertion, selection, merge, quick), and used these algorithms to implement Gram’s Scan algorithm.
- **Project 2 – hashing**
  - Implemented a hash table using iterators and separate chaining.
- **Project 3 - KD Tree**
  - Implemented a KD Tree with basic operations.
- **Project 4 – Shortest Path**
  - Implemented Dijkstra’s algorithm to find the shortest path in a graph.
